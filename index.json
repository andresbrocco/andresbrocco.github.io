In the current situation, Hungarians on average, both consumer and industrial, pay relatively more for their energy while using it less efficiently than their Western European counterparts. This weakens Hungary’s national competitiveness while simultaneously lowering consumer spending on non-energy categories. By reviewing leading manufacturing-oriented, energy-dependent countries, it shows that Hungary’s problems are not a given. Germany uses less than half the amount of energy Hungary uses to create a single euro of GDP. Japan has an excellent evaluation, planning and policy mix that resulted in exemplary energy savings in the past three decades. The Hungarian government can take a number of actions in the domestic economy to improve this situation, as well as initiate better co-operation regionally.","tags":["investments","environment","energy","regulation","Hungary"],"title":"AmCham Energy and Environment Committee published Position Brief","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel Antal"],"categories":null,"content":"The original title in Hungarian is Az üreshordozó díjrendszer vizsgálata.\n","date":1372647600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372647600,"objectID":"8152c355fba581beeeaae19a799a55c5","permalink":"https://andresbrocco.github.io/publication/pcr_hungary_2013/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00-03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pcr_hungary_2013/","section":"publication","summary":"An economic analysis of the evolution of private copying, its benefits for the Hungarian households and the equitable remuneration for music and film copyright and neighboring right owners.
